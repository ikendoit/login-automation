How To RUN : 

	 - Download the latest version of Chrome driver: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

	 - put the executable chromedriver in this directory (you can use pip-chrome driver, but the pip version is outdated and is a bit buggy)

     - chmod 775 run.sh

     - ./run.sh 

    enjoy !!

    after running run.sh for the first time, feel free to use:
